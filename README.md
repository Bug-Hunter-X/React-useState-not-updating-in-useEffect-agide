# React useState not updating within useEffect
This example demonstrates a common mistake in React where developers attempt to directly modify state variables within useEffect without using the state setter function. This leads to the state not updating and the component not re-rendering.

## Bug Description
The issue lies in the `useEffect` hook. The line `count = count + 1;` attempts to directly mutate the `count` variable. This does not trigger a re-render in React.  React only re-renders when state changes via the `setCount` function.
